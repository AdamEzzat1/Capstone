# Repository Name

## Description

This repository contains the complete capstone project, showcasing the development process from start to finish. The initial notebook focuses on data scraping from Kelley Blue Book, as the data obtained from Kaggle was missing essential information. The subsequent steps involve data cleaning and preprocessing, including the removal of rows with invalid entries, such as blank or antique car brands. Finally, the project explores various machine learning algorithms, such as linear regression, random forest, and ridge regression, to determine the most effective model.
